I'll be the first to admit that if Longoria has a poor season in 2013, he's gonna fall far in 2014, like, six to seven rounds later.  Still, I refuse to write off a 27-year-old with MVP potential.  He wasn't bad last year.  He was hurt.  I know, over-the-internet friend.  He's always hurt.  As late as November, he had an operation on his hamstring, the same hammy that plagued him last year.  He says he's fine now.  He just needs to stay healthy.  That is the only thing stopping him.  If you prorate his 2012 over a full year, he had a solid year.  A 32-homer, 100+ RBI, .285 season.  3rd base is a wasteland after the top eight, and even some of those (Wright, Hanley, Headley, Zimmerman, Aramis) aren't without their question marks.  Beltre was conspicuously absent from that list, but I'll get to him quicker than you can say, ""You have Longoria above Beltre?!""  As I said in my <a href=""http://razzball.com/todd-frazier-2013-fantasy-sleeper/"">Todd Frazier sleeper</a> post, there's a lot of late, terrible 3rd basemen.  If you're gambling on Hanley bouncing back, that's a different problem.  If you're gambling on Aramis not emitting a stank smell, that's a different issue.  If you're gambling on Zimmerman and Headley, they're a whole set of other problems.  I'll take the gamble on Longoria's health first.  Now if he's having hamstring issues in the spring...

I lurve 27-year-old hitters entering their prime.  Big time lurve.  My lurve doesn't have a painting of the Mona Lisa, it has a painting of Adam Jones.  Here's what we know for absolutely sure.  Over the past two seasons, he's averaging 28 homers, 14 steals, .284 average and 156 games.  He is now in the prime of his career.  Even if we only got an ""average"" year from him, you have a number one outfielder.  There's no weird injury issues.  He had a flukey wrist injury in June and his power was zapped for two-plus months.  In September, his power returned with six homers for the month.  No odd spikes in K-rate or ground balls or BABIP.  His line drive rate went up last year and, when he hit homers, only six of them were ""Just Enough"" out of 32.  The only thing that hurt his value last year were his 82 RBIs.  You and I -- hey, pal! -- both know that RBIs have nothing to do with him."14,Matt,Kemp,,OF,88,25,100,0.294,19,,,,,,,"This is a new tier.  This tier goes from here until A-Gon.

Kemp couldn't swing a bat until January due to a shoulder injury after he had surgery in October to reattach his labrum.

After the surgery, Kemp said, ""I was definitely surprised and disappointed.""  &lt;sarcastic&gt;This sounds awesome!&lt;/sarcastic&gt; I think he'll probably be his old-new-old self by late-May, and wouldn't be surprised to see him put up numbers similar to last year.  Unfortunately, his numbers last year were solid, but not spectacular.  It's a bit sucky that I'm going to miss out on his special brand of speed/power/handsomeness, but, with where I have him ranked, I probably won't be owning him in 2013."15,Josh,Hamilton,,OF,92,29,109,0.277,7,,,,,,,"I went over my <a href=""http://razzball.com/la-sick-of-just-angels-in-the-outfield/"">Josh Hamilton 2013 fantasy</a> when he signed with the Angels.

I am counting on a guy with burgeoning skills but health problems rather than a guy who looks like he could decline, but has been terrific the last two years.  I'm going with the injury risk over the guy who will be 34 years old on April 7th.  Beltre is admittedly a tough call for a few reasons.  His Texas home run per fly ball rates are above his career average, but he's also in Arlington and not Dodger Stadium or Safeco.  He has been injured in the past, but one was of the <a href=""http://razzball.com/fantasy-baseball-terms/#Jockular_Sphincteritis"">Jockular Sphincteritis</a> variety when a ball clipped his testicles, which sounds like an injury that would happen to a labradoodle.  Stop licking your wound!  That injury was of no fault of his (if it was his fault, he should see a shrink), so it's a bit too fluky to say he's injury-prone.  Also, care of <a href=""http://baseballheatmaps.com/"" target=""_blank"">baseballheatmaps.com</a> (a site you could get lost in for about an hour before you even start making sense of it; that's a compliment), Beltre's average home run went from 294.75 feet in 2010 to 287.6 feet in 2012, losing distance every year.  To continue the Longoria comparison, his 2011 distance was 287.5 and 2012 it was 295.3.  If Beltre reverts to his career mark in HR/FB% and he loses another few feet on his homers, you're going to have him go from a 32-35 homer guy to a 26-29 homer guy.  Then where do balls go if they're not leaving the park?  In outfielders' gloves.  If that happens, does he start hitting more ground balls?  He has in years past.  This isn't saying stay away from Beltre, but he's later on my draft board than I've seen him elsewhere."17,Ian,Kinsler,,2B,102,25,77,0.258,20,,,,,,,"Someone in this tier, if not the whole tier, will fail.

And I'm one hundred and sixty pounds soaking wet, and have been to the gym three times in my life; each time to sign up for a one-year membership that I never used.  I can't throw Jose Altuve!  Between Kinsler and Nelson Cruz, the Rangers could do an off-Broadway adaption of M.A.S.H.  (It's the cross-dressing, Corporal Kinsler.), and that's the bulk of the Rangers offense.  Last year, Kinsler's HR/FB rate went into the toilet, but it seems to happen every other year, which leads him to hit 30+ homers every odd year.  He's second base's equivalent to Prince Fielder.   Call him Kingsler."18,Jose,Bautista,,OF,91,32,100,0.272,5,,,,,,,"Nothing in his line from last year looks necessarily bad if you account for bad luck.

Unfortunately, he had wrist surgery and wasn't able to swing a bat until November.  He says, I feel ""great"" and his strength is ""coming back quickly"" and the chicken parm is ""like Mama used to make.""  Hey, Bautista should work for Zagat.

AuShizz had no business stealing 18 bags last year, and had every right to hit about ten more home runs than his 20 homer total.  For those that missed our <a href=""http://razzball.com/the-razzball-podcast-the-one-where-we-call-it-a-wrap-for-the-season-and-interview-steve-garvey/"">Steve Garvey interview</a>, Goldschmidt was the one guy Rudy and I agreed on that we are crazy excited about for thirteen after twenty.  His park is a solid hitters' stadium -- that's assuming the Diamondbacks don't trade away Goldschmidt because he has a Germanic last name -- ""Be gone, Krauts!""  That's Kevin Towers. -- and Paul has great upside.  Something that is not easy to find early in the 1st basemen rankings.  Out of this tier, I'm most excited about drafting Goldschmidt.

Maybe he needs Stoli and pineapple juice like Frank the Tank and Miggy...""  A-Gon's line drive rate went up to a career high in 2012 and his fly balls were normal.  His HR/FB rate was in the dumper.  He should've hit 27 homers last year.  His walk rate that has been on decline for the last three years hit a new low in 2012 at 6.1%.  For a guy that had a walk rate of 17.5% as recently as 2009, that's hideous.  Since he's only going to be 31 years old in May, I think he can hold his line drive rate and rebound a bit with his walks.  The homers will definitely rebound.  Remember, we are drafting for 2013, not for the mistakes you made in 2012.  Edwin Encarnacion was great last year, but unless you're driving a DeLorean to your fantasy draft that means absolutely nothing."21,Justin,Verlander,,SP,,,,,,20,7,2.71,1.03,234,0,"This is the first tier.¾ This tier goes from here until Felix Hernandez.¾ I call this tier, ""These guys are the best.¾ I will enjoy missing out on them.""

If you draft Tulowitzki, you'll probably lose your league.  Whether he stays healthy and produces or not.  The absolute best year I can expect from him is 30 homers, 12 steals and a .300 average.  Before you say he could do much better, he could, and aliens could land on Earth and make me ruler of the planet because they appreciate a good mustache.  I don't expect that to happen, just as I don't expect Tulo to match the best season of his career.  But let's assume as the new ruler of the planet I can make Tulo have a good season because with my new position as ruler, I have telekinetic power and they call me The Rainmaker and when I use my TK the only thing I'm interested in is Tulo hitting well but not the implications of time travel.  But as ruler of the planet, I also technically own every fantasy team so the victory is all mine.

The last time everyone was crazy about a catcher in the 2nd round was Joe Mauer after he hit 28 homers.  You probably have a ton of reasons why Mauer is not the same as Posey.  Let me say this, four years ago, you thought Mauer was the King Shizz of Shinola.  You asked your girlfriend to wear a Mauer jersey when you were feeling amorous and then you'd tell people you were calling her, ""Joe,"" like it was a cutesy nickname.  You loved Mauer.  Exactly the same love you now have for Posey.  Do us all a flippin' favor, don't draft a guy you're going to put in your catcher slot in the mother-flippin' second round.  It is the surest recipe for disaster.  Let's go with the assumption that Posey is capable of repeating his MVP season, even if that makes an ass out of u and mption.  His year was 78/24/103/.336/1.  He barely broke 100 RBIs and didn't break 80 runs.  Aside from the batting average, nothing in his line looks exceptional.  Discussion starter:  Is there any chance he's a .336 hitter?  I guess.  He just did it.  He also needed a BABIP thirty points over his career average.  If he hit 25 homers and .300 with those counting stats, we're not even discussing this.  Discussion ender.  You are basically looking at drafting a guy that could give you the power and counting stats over the course of the season that Jay Bruce could give you in four months.  But...BUT Bruce would give you more steals.  You draft Posey, and I'll take Salvador Perez 100 picks later.

As my saying goes, Hanley is coasting on good vibes and bad farts.  He looked like a surefire Hall of Famer his first five years in the league, but now he's passing off a Skor bar in a photoshopped Heath Bar wrapper.  Who even goes through the trouble of photoshopping a Heath Bar wrapper?  Hanley does, that's who!  He's devious trying to appeal to you.  The Straight Dope Message Boards are saying Hanley retired two years ago and he's been putting a uniform and glove on top of a Roomba.  I think that's stretching the truth.  A Roomba would play better defense.  Anecdotal evidence aside, last year Hanley's K-rate shot up to his career high, his walk rate dropped.  He went from a .400 OBP guy to a .330 OBP guy.  He is no longer a .320 average hitter.  The biggest difference in his peripherals is he hit 30.5% of pitches outside the strike zone last year.  That's a huge difference from his career 24.4%.  That tells me A) He's not waiting for his pitches because he doesn't care.  B) The contact he's making isn't as good as the contact he used to make, so he's hitting dribblers to 2nd base and lazy fly balls.  C) There's no C.  He's a 20/20, .260 hitter.  There's a place for that but it's not where he's probably being drafted. The Dodgers have epic collapse written all over them before they even take the field.  Kershaw, Billingsley, Crawford and Kemp's injuries, then Hanley, A-Gon, Ethier and Beckett... It's all too convenient.  And don't tell me the lineup is going to be great, and Hanley will be a benefactor of that.

He could also take the smallest of steps backwards and be nothing but a top ten shortstop (which isn't terrific).  That's the problem with shortstops, in general, and what I meant by the tier name.  There's very little room for error, which still doesn't help the value of defensive wiz, Brendan Ryan.  Castro's undeniably a middle of the order hitter, which will mean counting stats.  On the flip side, it's the Cubs order.  He's young.  On the flip side, as we saw last year with Justin Upton, young doesn't always mean a step forward.  He has 20-homer power and 30-steal speed.  On the flip side, he can't steal with speed alone.  His caught stealing rate is egregious, with 13 times caught last year in 38 attempts.  His power will peak at 20, but that also means he could hit 12 homers.  A 12-homer, 20-steal guy isn't great.  A 20-homer, 30-steal guy is.

The results might have been skewed slightly for the first two because last year they were just bad without any real streak of good.  Jay Bruce was a no brainer, which is my specialty.  He wasn't at the top of the list, but he's way above average for streakiness.  Keep this in mind if you draft him.

He had 27 homers.  His 16.9 HR/FB% was a tad high, but repeatable.  The rising K-rate and falling walk rate aren't great, but as long as he can maintain those ratios he hits .269 again.  If he takes a small step forward, he hits .280.  His 21 steals last year are the absolute peak.  Chances are he loses at least 5 steals, maybe ten.

At a <a href=""http://razzball.com/fantasy-baseball-terms/#Latin_(Fill_in_Age)"">Latin 22 years old</a>, Perez's 2012 76-game showcase should be seen merely as the tip of the iceberg, right ahead!  Out of 28 catchers that had at least 300 plate appearances, Perez was number one for strikeout rate.  He was beyond excellent with an under 9% strikeout rate.  This alone would lead me to believe there's no way he hits below .285 without some hideous luck and there's a chance he hits something like .320. He doesn't walk at all, but I'm willing to give him a slight bye here because his contact rate is so strong.  As the guy who smelled like Schlitz in Little League told you, put the ball into play and good things happen.   The best real world example is Yadier ""Don't Call Me Alfred"" Molina.  I worry Perez won't hit power for a few years, but he could develop it.  11 homers last year makes me think (or methinks, if leprechauns are reading) the power is developing.

He doesn't have overpowering stuff (90-ish MPH fastball), but he keeps the ball down (around the same as Cueto), and he's in a solid ballpark.  In the 1st half last year, he had a 3.74 ERA, 1.26 WHIP and a 3.04 ERA, 1.11 WHIP after the break.  His BABIP and K-rate was nearly identical between the two halfs.  Walks were the difference.  In May, his mechanics were off like the one effin' day your car breaks down.  His walk rate in May was 5.46, which led to a 6.07 ERA.  Easily his worst month.  Niese is going to be the Mets ace.

If that doesnêt tell you all you need to know, you need to know too much.  Nosy!  Mastroianni will steal 40 bases, and even hit three times as many homers as Revere (i.e., three homers), but he might not hit .250.  He strikes out a lot for a lead off man.  Daringiuseppe, 'Your momma strikes out a lot!  Hey-oh!'”  And that's me quoting me!"357,Chris,Parmelee,,"1B, OF",54,15,64,0.268,1,,,,,,,"I don't know nothing about fantasy basketball but Chris Parmelee sounds like a basketball player to me.  Parmelee down low... No look to Mastroianni and now I'm announcing an Italian national basketball team.  What they lack in basketball skills, they more than make up in hand gestures and armpit hair.  The Twins are so terrible that they might actually play Parmelee for the whole year.  Then again, the Twins are awful, so that sword cuts both ways, Samurai Jack.  Here's what I said last year about Parmelee, ""Chris Parmelee just likes September.  In 2011, he hit 4 homers and a .355 average in September.  Maybe itês because of that goth chick he used to date that showed him the virtues of September, and its dying flowers.  Maybe itês because his abusive father left his family in September seventeen years ago.  Maybe itês because he plays in Minnesota and in September the girls finally start covering up.  The preceding was an excerpt from Chris Parmeleeês autobiography, –Running With Scissors and a Chicken Parm Sandwich,” which was ghost written by the guy who wrote the early 80?s film, My Bodyguard.  The book jacket has his minor league stats:  17 homers, .338/.457/.645 in 64 games in Triple-A in 2012; heês ready for the major leagues.  In 48 games with the Twins, he has 5 homers and heês striking out a little too much.  He might not get you a .270 average, and the chapters in his book about when he went to live with his psychiatrist, who operated out of the back of a pizzeria, are dry, but he should be owned for his power.""  And that's me quoting me!"358,Lucas,Duda,,OF,51,17,62,0.252,1,,,,,,,"Broke his wrist in November trying to grow a mustache for Movember, which will probably hurt his power.  I suppose Duda could still hit 20 homers in a full season of at-bats.  I suppose I could also poop in my hand and call it fudge.  Neither are probably happening.

I didn't read the article beyond the title and sometimes they're talking real baseball-wise with WAR, fielding and other things that don't pertain to us, but, with all due respect, Furcal's been done since May of 2008.  Right now, Furcal is questionable for Opening Day.  It'll depend on whether or not The Liberation Army of Pete Kozma successfully plots out its take-over mission.

I wonder if when Gomes was signed by the Red Sox even he was like, ""Wow, about five years ago the Red Sox would never sign someone like me.  Bummer.  On so many levels.""  Does Gomes have that kind of self-reflection?  Is his inner monologue such a downer for him?  Why are we talking about Jonny Effin' Gomes?  Ciriaco could've had an Elvis Andrus-type year with an everyday job.  Now he has to wait for an injury...

Shoot, I just watched Breaking Bad, about four years after everyone else, but has any show taken a quicker nose dive than Homeland?  SPOILER ALERT (Though I'm saving you from watching it):  Nazir's big plan is to come to the states, secretly kill the VP then get killed so hopefully Brody will go to the VP's funeral?  Convoluted Plot, ""Hello, have you missed me?""  And what if Brody didn't go to the funeral because, I don't know, he was in the room when the VP died and basically killed him?  Maybe someone might have detained him about this since he was considered, I don't know, a terrorist.  Then Carrie tells him to go to Canada?  I understand Canadians may get news a day later due to carrier pigeons struggling to fly north, but this is where you send someone who is probably the most infamous person in the world?  Maybe he can grow a beard and wear a lumberjack flannel.  No one will ever find him then, he'll blend right in with all Canadian women!  Ugh, what a mess they made of a solid show.  Hiroyuki looks like he has some light power and speed, which translates to barely usable in Oaktownco.  I'd let someone else give him a whirl.""

He had the worst walk rate in the major leagues last year.  He stopped throwing his fastball and reverted to throwing nothing but cutters and curves.  Now whether that was because of an injury, I don't know.  He did have elbow surgery in October.  This was relatively minor elbow surgery, if any elbow surgery can be for a pitcher.  Since his pitch selection so dramatically changed in 2012, it would make sense that it was due to a hidden injury that might be fixed now.  I'm just not risking it coming out of a draft.
