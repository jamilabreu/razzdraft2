Ain't that right, boo?  True.  Something people are not saying is that we may never see another year like that from Trout.  His highest homer output in any pro season before was in Double-A when he hit 11 homers.  Granted, it was only in 91 games, but still.  Before he was called up, he only had one homer in Triple-A last year in 20 games.  His May, when he hit 5 homers and had a 15.6% HR/FB, looks doable.  His June with 3 homers and a 12.5% HR/FB is easy for him.  Like Trout shooting his kinfolk in a barrel.  His July with 10 homers and a 31.3% HR/FB is silly.  If he hits 41% fly balls all year as he did in July, he's not going to hit 60 homers on the year.  What he will do is hit 25 homers and .270 or lower.  In 40 games in 2011 when he hit 40% fly balls, he hit .220.  He has top echelon speed.  He needs to hit line drives and ground balls with the occasional home run.  The 49 steals don't look like a fluke.  He's the fastest white boy I've seen since Jason Mewes stopped doing crank.

He's 29 years old and should be fine with the offseason rest.

The thing is, you don't know what is going to happen with runs and RBIs beyond a clean-up hitter should get around 100-something RBIs and 90-something runs.  Maybe Juan Pierre will decide to steal 2nd 70 times and Giancarlo will knock in 120 RBIs.  Maybe Giancarlo will hit 45 solo homers and only score 52 runs all year.  Maybe they take down the center field sculpture of unicorn vomit, realize that was actually blocking a jetstream and Stanton hits 70 homers.  Maybe the dude who wrote up the Mayan calender in 12,000 B.C. had sloppy handwriting and meant 2013 for the apocalypse.  Forget maybes.  Stanton will hit 40+ homers, steal 7 bases and hit .275.

Unless your imagination also includes dwarfs.  That season was still 107/17/67/.280/18.  That was with a career low HR/FB%, which was coupled by a thumb injury that he needed fluid drained from in April.  He played through the injury, but not until August did it really start to feel better.  How do I know this?  He hit nine homers in August and September combined.  In the four months combined before that, he hit 8 homers.  In September alone, he hit 6 homers and .301.  Further, he was playing with a pad around his thumb for the majority of last season.  His thumb felt good enough in August to remove the pad.  When he removed the pad, he hit eight homers in his final 36 games.  Don't make me say it again.  Okay, one more time.  He hit 8 homers in 36 games when his thumb finally was healed.  If you wanna draft for 2012, then draft Edwin Encarnacion.  If you wanna draft for 2013, draft Justin Upton.  Albright out.  Update: Albright back in.  After the above was written, Upton moved to be closer to his big brother in Atlanta.  This is like a Mitch Albom book.  B.J.'s schnauzer will now get a rare disease and the mutual love of the dog will bring the two Uptons together, which will be captured on a limited edition Topps baseball card.  The card will be in black and white and Gale Sayers will begin signing the card before motivational speeches.  Nothing changes from what I said pre-trade about Upton.  Chase Field is slightly better; his lineup will be better; Turner Field isn't a bad park to hit in; the sight of his brother's dirty underwears in his locker like when they were kids will motivate him.

He wasn't bad last year.  He was hurt.  I know, over-the-internet friend.  He's always hurt.  As late as November, he had an operation on his hamstring, the same hammy that plagued him last year.  He says he's fine now.  He just needs to stay healthy.  That is the only thing stopping him.  If you prorate his 2012 over a full year, he had a solid year.  A 32-homer, 100+ RBI, .285 season.  3rd base is a wasteland after the top eight, and even some of those (Wright, Hanley, Headley, Zimmerman, Aramis) aren't without their question marks.  Beltre was conspicuously absent from that list, but I'll get to him quicker than you can say, ""You have Longoria above Beltre?!""  As I said in my <a href=""http://razzball.com/todd-frazier-2013-fantasy-sleeper/"">Todd Frazier sleeper</a> post, there's a lot of late, terrible 3rd basemen.  If you're gambling on Hanley bouncing back, that's a different problem.  If you're gambling on Aramis not emitting a stank smell, that's a different issue.  If you're gambling on Zimmerman and Headley, they're a whole set of other problems.  I'll take the gamble on Longoria's health first.  Now if he's having hamstring issues in the spring...

I am counting on a guy with burgeoning skills but health problems rather than a guy who looks like he could decline, but has been terrific the last two years.  I'm going with the injury risk over the guy who will be 34 years old on April 7th.  Beltre is admittedly a tough call for a few reasons.  His Texas home run per fly ball rates are above his career average, but he's also in Arlington and not Dodger Stadium or Safeco.  He has been injured in the past, but one was of the <a href=""http://razzball.com/fantasy-baseball-terms/#Jockular_Sphincteritis"">Jockular Sphincteritis</a> variety when a ball clipped his testicles, which sounds like an injury that would happen to a labradoodle.  Stop licking your wound!  That injury was of no fault of his (if it was his fault, he should see a shrink), so it's a bit too fluky to say he's injury-prone.  Also, care of <a href=""http://baseballheatmaps.com/"" target=""_blank"">baseballheatmaps.com</a> (a site you could get lost in for about an hour before you even start making sense of it; that's a compliment), Beltre's average home run went from 294.75 feet in 2010 to 287.6 feet in 2012, losing distance every year.  To continue the Longoria comparison, his 2011 distance was 287.5 and 2012 it was 295.3.  If Beltre reverts to his career mark in HR/FB% and he loses another few feet on his homers, you're going to have him go from a 32-35 homer guy to a 26-29 homer guy.  Then where do balls go if they're not leaving the park?  In outfielders' gloves.  If that happens, does he start hitting more ground balls?  He has in years past.

He barely broke 100 RBIs and didn't break 80 runs.  Aside from the batting average, nothing in his line looks exceptional.  Discussion starter:  Is there any chance he's a .336 hitter?  I guess.  He just did it.  He also needed a BABIP thirty points over his career average.  If he hit 25 homers and .300 with those counting stats, we're not even discussing this.  Discussion ender.  You are basically looking at drafting a guy that could give you the power and counting stats over the course of the season that Jay Bruce could give you in four months.

Who even goes through the trouble of photoshopping a Heath Bar wrapper?  Hanley does, that's who!  He's devious trying to appeal to you.  The Straight Dope Message Boards are saying Hanley retired two years ago and he's been putting a uniform and glove on top of a Roomba.  I think that's stretching the truth.  A Roomba would play better defense.  Anecdotal evidence aside, last year Hanley's K-rate shot up to his career high, his walk rate dropped.  He went from a .400 OBP guy to a .330 OBP guy.  He is no longer a .320 average hitter.  The biggest difference in his peripherals is he hit 30.5% of pitches outside the strike zone last year.  That's a huge difference from his career 24.4%.  That tells me A) He's not waiting for his pitches because he doesn't care.  B) The contact he's making isn't as good as the contact he used to make, so he's hitting dribblers to 2nd base and lazy fly balls.  C) There's no C.  He's a 20/20, .260 hitter.  There's a place for that but it's not where he's probably being drafted. The Dodgers have epic collapse written all over them before they even take the field.  Kershaw, Billingsley, Crawford and Kemp's injuries, then Hanley, A-Gon, Ethier and Beckett... It's all too convenient.

He could also take the smallest of steps backwards and be nothing but a top ten shortstop (which isn't terrific).  That's the problem with shortstops, in general, and what I meant by the tier name.  There's very little room for error, which still doesn't help the value of defensive wiz, Brendan Ryan.  Castro's undeniably a middle of the order hitter, which will mean counting stats.  On the flip side, it's the Cubs order.  He's young.  On the flip side, as we saw last year with Justin Upton, young doesn't always mean a step forward.  He has 20-homer power and 30-steal speed.  On the flip side, he can't steal with speed alone.  His caught stealing rate is egregious, with 13 times caught last year in 38 attempts.  His power will peak at 20, but that also means he could hit 12 homers.  A 12-homer, 20-steal guy isn't great.  A 20-homer, 30-steal guy is.
